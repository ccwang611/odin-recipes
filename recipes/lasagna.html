			<li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) diced tomatoes</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 cup (240ml) red wine (optional)</li>
			<li>15 ounces(425g) ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>3 cups (about 340g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>1 cup (about 100g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>
				2 cups (about 180g) chopped fresh spinach or frozen spinach, thawed and
				drained (optional)
			</li>
			<li>1/4 cup (60ml) fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat your oven to 190C</li>
			<li>
				In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add chopped
				onions and minced garlic, saut√©ing until the onions are translucent.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir in crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano,
				dried basil, salt, and pepper. If desired, pour in red wine for added
				flavor. Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to
				meld.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, mixing
				until well blended. Add chopped spinach and fresh parsley if using, and
				mix thoroughly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and
				set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Assemble the lasagna in a baking dish. Begin with a layer of meat sauce,
				followed by a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a portion of the ricotta
				mixture over the noodles, and sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan
				cheese. Repeat the layers until the dish is filled, finishing with a
				layer of cheese on top.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven
				for 25-30 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for an additional 10-15
				minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This
				helps set the layers and makes it easier to serve.
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve the lasagna slices on plates, and enjoy this delicious, comforting
				dish!
