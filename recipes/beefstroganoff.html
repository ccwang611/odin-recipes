		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Beef Stroganoff is a classic and indulgent comfort dish that boasts a
			rich, savory profile and a velvety texture. Thin strips of tender beef,
			often sirloin or fillet, are seared to perfection, creating a robust
			foundation for the dish. The star of the show is the luxurious stroganoff
			sauce, a luscious blend of onions, garlic, and mushrooms sautéed in
			butter, then simmered with beef broth, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire
			sauce. The crowning glory comes from the addition of sour cream, which
			imparts a creamy, tangy finish to the sauce.
		</p>
		<p>
			This tantalizing concoction is typically served over a bed of egg noodles
			or rice, allowing the noodles to soak up the decadent flavors. With its
			combination of succulent beef, earthy mushrooms, and a velvety sauce, Beef
			Stroganoff remains a timeless and beloved dish that never fails to evoke
			feelings of warmth and satisfaction.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				1.5 pounds (680g) beef sirloin or fillet, thinly sliced into strips
			</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>8 ounces (225g) mushrooms, sliced</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups (360ml) beef broth</li>
			<li>1 cup (240ml) sour cream</li>
			<li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
			<li>Cooked egg noodles or rice for serving</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Season the thinly sliced beef with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>
				Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef
				strips and sear until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the
				skillet and set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and sauté until softened. Add
				minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, cooking until the mushrooms release
				their moisture and become golden brown.
			</li>
			<li>
				Push the vegetables to the side of the skillet and melt butter on the
				empty side. Sprinkle flour over the butter and stir to create a roux.
				Cook for a minute or two.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir in tomato paste, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce, mixing
				well with the roux and vegetables.
			</li>
			<li>
				Gradually pour in beef broth, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
				Allow the mixture to simmer and thicken.
			</li>
			<li>
				Return the seared beef to the skillet and simmer in the sauce for a few
				minutes until the beef is cooked through.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reduce the heat to low and gently stir in sour cream, ensuring it is
				well incorporated into the sauce. Be careful not to let the sauce boil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Adjust salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, you can add
				a bit more beef broth.
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve the Beef Stroganoff over cooked egg noodles or rice. Garnish with
				chopped fresh parsley.
			</li>
