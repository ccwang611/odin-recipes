# odin-recipes

This project will be about creating recipes.
So far I've learned about html basics from setting up my document to hyperlinks and lists. This project will be to put my knowledge to test.
Right now I'm feeling scared, but still feeling motivated to learn this.
I need to prove to myself once and for, that after all these years of "trying" to learn how to code HTML/CSS/JS that I can ACTUALLY DO IT.
I'm alsways inspired by the thought that I CAN do things - like that 30 day jogging challenge.
